    <h2>Ok cool. Why the switch up in careers?</h2>
    <p>Because I want to make educational software and websites that are fun AND far more accesable than present. 
        Kids do love to learn using technology, but we should make the tech a lot more open to making mistakes. To have fun, to make mistakes, and learn from them. 
        In other words, make the edutech experience a great open sandbox. Just like tech...</p>
 
TRY THIS OUT FOR THREE SECTIONS TO MAKE IT COOL!!
